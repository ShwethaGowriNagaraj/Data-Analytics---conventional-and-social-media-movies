## Data Exploration

```{r}
#CHECKING MISSING VALUES:
#install.packages("pastecs")
library(pastecs)
summary(csm)

#To find stat values (total n, number of null values, number of na's, Mean, Median Min, MAx etc)
stat.desc(csm)

#To find duplicate rows
sum(duplicated(csm))

# There are no duplicate rows in the dataset.
```

## Checking the distribution of each variables before data cleaning.

```{r}
hist(csm$Budget, breaks=15, xlab = "Budget", main = "Historgram of Budget",col="green")

hist(csm$Ratings, breaks=15, xlab = "Ratings", main = "Historgram of Ratings",col="blue")

hist(csm$Likes, breaks=15, xlab = "Likes", main = "Historgram of Likes",col="red")

hist(csm$Views, breaks=15, xlab = "Views", main = "Historgram of Views",col="brown")
```

## Data Cleaning:

```{r}
#Dealing with missing values and error data
#To find NA values
colSums(is.na(csm))

#Heat map to visualize missing values
library(VIM)
missing.values <- aggr(csm, sortVars = T, prop = T, sortCombs = T, cex.lab = 1.5, cex.axis = .6, cex.numbers = 5, combined = F, gap = -.2)

#To check complete cases in the dataset
sum(complete.cases(csm))

#187 rows are coomplete cases, 44 rows does have missing values.

#Does my data have any missing value
apply(csm,2,function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

# There are missing values or NA's in our dataset.(budget-1,screens-10,aggr.followers-35)

#Now, letâ€™s use apply() function to get percent missing by rows:
percentmiss = function(x){sum(is.na(x))/length(x)*100}
missing <- apply(csm,1,percentmiss)
table(missing)

#To subset the bad rows out
replace = subset(csm, missing <= 5)
missing1 = apply(replace,1,percentmiss)
table(missing1)

dont = subset(csm, missing > 5)
missing2 = apply(dont,1,percentmiss)
table(missing2)

apply(csm,2,percentmiss)

#Figuring out the columns to be excluded
replace_col = replace[,-c(1,2)]
dont_col = replace[,c(1,2)]

#USing Mice to know what and how to replace the data
library(mice)
temp_no_miss = mice(replace_col)

no_miss = complete(temp_no_miss,1)
summary(no_miss)

#Putting everything back together
all_col = cbind(dont_col, no_miss)
summary(all_col)

```

#DOes our data have any outliers?

```{r}
##OUTLIERS 

select_cols <- all_rows[ ,-c(1,2)]

mahal = mahalanobis(select_cols,
                    colMeans(select_cols, na.rm=TRUE),
                    cov(select_cols, use ="pairwise.complete.obs"),
                    tol=1e-20

summary(mahal)

#Find the cutoff score to deal with outliers

print(cutoff)

summary(mahal < cutoff)

cor_data = subset(all_rows, mahal < cutoff)
str(cor_data)

```

## Assumption:

# 1. Additivity:

```{r}
cor(cor_data[,-c(1,2)])

library(corrplot)

corrplot(cor(cor_data[,-c(1,2)]))
symnum(cor(cor_data[,-c(1,2)]))

```

# Assumption: If you have several predictors then their combined effect is best described by adding their effects together. Look for a B ,*

# Observation: It has no B and *. but it has the correlation coefficient as 0.8 (+) which is somewhat closer to 1 and slightly high correlation. We can conclude that the assumption is not met for additivity.

# 2. Linearity:

```{r}
random = rchisq(nrow(cor_data[,-c(1,2)]), 11)
fake = lm(random~., data = cor_data[,-c(1,2)])
summary(fake)

standardized = rstudent(fake)
qqnorm(standardized)
abline(0,1)

```
# Assumption: The relationship between the variables should be linear and the line should not be curved.

# Observation: The line is not curved and it denotes the linear relationship among the variables.

# 3. Normality:

```{r}
hist(standardized, breaks = 15)
```

# Assumption: All the linear combinations of the variables need to be normal.

# Observation: The curve is not normal, looks like skewed to the right, so we can say that the assumption is not met.

## 4. Homogeneity and Homoscedesticity:

```{r}

fitvalues = scale(fake$fitted.values)
plot(fitvalues, standardized) 
abline(0,0)
abline(v = 0)

plot(fake,1)
```

# Assumption: 
For Homogeniety, the spread above the line should be same as below that 0, 0 line.
For Homoscedesticity, the spread should be equal all the way across the x axis

# Observation: 
Yes, They are evenly spread above and below the line and Based on the spread above and below the line, the homogeneity of the variances cannot be rejected.
Yes, Since the points are random and the line looks approximately flat, we can accept the homoscedasticity

## HYPOTHESIS TESTING:

#1.The budget of the movies does have an impact on the popularity of the film.

```{r}
hypo_check1 <- lm(cor_data$Ratings~cor_data$Budget)
summary(hypo_check1)

t.test(cor_data$Ratings, cor_data$Budget, var.equal = TRUE)
```

# Observation: Since the p value (0.0001) is too small which is less than 0.05, we can conclude that we can reject the null hypothesis and say that the popularity of the film is not impacted by the budget of the movie.

# 2. There is no relationship between the likes/dislikes of the movies and the rating of the movies.

```{r}
hypo_check2 <- lm(cor_data$Ratings~cor_data$Likes + cor_data$Dislikes)
summary(hypo_check2)

t.test(cor_data$Ratings, cor_data$Likes + cor_data$Dislikes, var.equal = TRUE)
```
# Observation: Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis, hence The likes/dislikes of the movie determines the rating of the movies.

## Data Visualization:

#HISTOGRAMS to check the Normality and data distribution.

## CHOOSING THE BEST MODEL

# 1. Backward Elimination (p-value approach)

```{r, qbest}

#m9 <-lm(Ratings ~ Likes + Dislikes, data=cor_data)
#summary(m9)

m_all <- lm( Ratings ~ Aggregate.Followers + Gross + Budget + Likes + Comments + Screens + Dislikes + Views, data = cor_data)
summary(m_all)

m_all_1 <- lm( Ratings ~ Aggregate.Followers + Gross + Likes + Comments + Screens + Dislikes + Views, data = cor_data)
summary(m_all_1)

m_all_2 <- lm( Ratings ~ Gross + Likes + Comments + Screens + Dislikes + Views, data = cor_data)
summary(m_all_2)

m_all_3 <- lm( Ratings ~ Gross + Likes + Screens + Dislikes + Views, data = cor_data)
summary(m_all_3)

m_all_4 <- lm( Ratings ~ Gross + Likes + Dislikes + Views, data = cor_data)
summary(m_all_4)

```

#m_all_4 is the best model as p values are less than 0.05
#y = 6.066 + 5.247*10^-9*(Gross) +  2.77*10^-5*(Likes) - 1.047*10^-3*(Dislikes) + 8.63*10^-8*(Views)
#35.28% Variability in the Rating Score or Popularity is explained by the model
#A movie with a million USD Gross, 10000 Likes and 500 Dislikes and with 100k Views is likely to get a rating of 6.066+0.0052+0.277-0.524+0.00863 = 5.83283
